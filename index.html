    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Forecasting stock price movements is a heavily studied subject, often focusing on numerical trends or current events. Earnings calls are a promising input to this sort of analysis because these are when the company discloses their quarterly performance. Recent 
advances in LLMs provide novel opportunities to analyze large, unstructured linguistic data, like transcripts from earnings calls. However, a single LLM agent cannot assess all of the important dimensions of these lengthy documents.
Factors like emotion, financial fundamentals, and logic are all features from these transcripts that are indicative of executives' expectations for company performance, but single agent's tend to underexplore these. In order to overcome a single agent's narrow reasoning abilities, a multiagent debate (MAD)
framework can be used to prompt agents to each explore one dimension individually, then reason amongst each other to make predictions about future stock value. After debating, they can either agree on future stock value, or a judge can assess their arguments and make a final decision.
Ultimately, this approach was twice as accurate for predicting whether a company's stock value will increase, decrease, or remain stable over the next quarter compared to a single agent. However, the agent's were not able to provide any sort of meaningful confidence level, as these did not correlate strongly to returns.</p>

<p class="sys-img"><img src="./files/pipeline.png" alt="imgname"></p>

<p>Quarterly earnings call presentation and Q&A transcripts from these ten companies were provided to the agents in order for them to predict the trajectory of the stock value over the next three months. 
Due to compute restraints, theese transcripts had to be truncated to just the last 20000 tokens, roughly half of the transcripts.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction / Background / Motivation</h2>

<p>
<b>Objective</b>
</p>
<p>
I built a system that takes in a transcript from a company's earnings call presentation or Q&A session, prompted agents to explore some key dimensions (financial fundamentals, emotion, and logic), and then debate amongst themselves in order to predict what these dimensions suggest about the company's stock value over the next quarter.
These agents would discuss for two rounds and then either agree on a prediction, or a judge personality would assess their debate and make a final prediction. This system provides insight into whether or not these features are predictive for future stock value.
Furthermore, this work demonstrates that multiple agents are able to reason better across multiple dimensions than a single agent.</p>

<p>
<b>Previous Work</b>
</p>
<p>
Often, these predictions are made base on basic financial numbers or from other language sources, like social media and news stories. These might contain some important signals, but they are likely different than those in earnings calls
  because earnins calls contain insider-adjacent information (as in, it is coming from people at the company). This makes them potentially more useful because they are less skeptical than social media, for example. 
  Also, single agent's can try to reason, but they often suffer from degeneration of thought and tend to not correct themselves. This makes their reasoning rather flawed, because they build off of bad logic. They also
  focus narrowly on only a few features, lacking breadth in their reasoning.
<p>

<p>
<b>Motivation</b>
</p>
<p>
Investors, analysts, and researchers care because earnings calls influence billions of dollars. This system could provide some insight into what is contained in these calls that correlates to stock value, aiding investors.
  This also further demonstrates that multiagent systems are more capable at reasoning than single agents, which has important implications for intelligent systems.
